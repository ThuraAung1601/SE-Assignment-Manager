### Notes:
- **Persistence**: Each class inherits from `persistent.Persistent`, indicating that instances of these classes will be persistent, likely using a storage mechanism such as ZODB (as inferred from your previous context).
  
- **Grade Calculation**: In `Course`, grades are calculated using a grading scheme, which can be adjusted. The `scoreGradingAsNum()` method is used to convert grades into GPA scores.

- **Student GPA**: In `Student`, GPA is calculated based on the scores from enrolled courses and their respective credits. The GPA formula is based on the weighted average of scores.

- **File Handling**: Both `Assignment` and `Announcement` have file attachment handling capabilities. When files are uploaded (or removed), the paths are stored and managed.
